                    <P>
                        Any employer contemplating offering a job to Griffiths should carefully check the facts and his referees as they will all be 'Mates' and 'Consultants' that he promises future work to in return for a positive beat up of his nonexistent qualifications and employment history.

                    <div class="details">
                       <p>Griffiths had a 5 month probationary stint at Hello Real Estate Ltd during which time he obtained the information he is currently touting as his own. This information was developed by Hello Investors and Senior Management supported by professionally engaged consultants both in Australia and overseas, it does not belong to Griffiths, he has no legal or legitimate claim to any of this business information.</p>

                       <p>
                        Griffiths has never worked in the real estate space prior to his short time at Hello and he was terminated on the 31st December 2015 due to poor performance and what turned out to be false declarations to the board and shareholders by Griffiths and the CFO in respect to financial forecasts, creditor amounts (which were patently incorrect) and other matters. </p>
                        <p>His legally entitled due payout was around $38k, he inflated this to over $300k using false claims and lies regarding matters that he simply concocted. He also induced the companies technical partner (with whom he now has a business relationship) to inflate his claim from the legitimate amount of $60k which Griffiths and the CFO presented to the board as the real amount to over $200k. He made a secret deal unknown to any of the directors to increase another consultants claim from $78k to $279k. 
                    </p>
                    <p>All of these matters are clearly supported by documentation. The Liquidator of Real Estate Systems Ltd has stated clearly that Griffiths has no role or position with his company and is not 'working with him to get a return for creditors', this is simply another false claim. His claimed number of $1.9 mill owing to creditors includes his and his associates concocted claims of over $900k.</p>

                    This was Griffiths only CEO role of his whole career, his only true claim to fame during his time at Broadreach was that he left the company after engaging Broadreach Services in litigation against its two largest clients. (Again this is all a matter of Public Record and easily confirmed by a call to the Broadreach owner).

                <P><span class="project-tagline">Strangely this position never existed, Perot Head Office in Hillsdale USA has never heard of Griffiths, if he had such a high profile job for 4 years with such a massive corporation  (which it appears he didn't) one would think that there would be at least one Perot Systems, Perot Corporation or other Perot division executive amongst Griffiths extensive LinkedIn Contacts, there are none! The DELL logo supporting his Perot job is an interesting addition as the DELL/PEROT deal was done after his claimed employment period with Perot</span></P>
