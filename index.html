                            <p>He has made outrageous and totally false claims about his position at Hello Real Estate Ltd (he kept his LinkedIn Profile claiming to be the CEO of Hello for 5 months AFTER his employment was terminated until LinkedIn's Legal Department forced him to change it). </p>
                            <p>
                                He has presented Proprietary Hello Business Information to numerous Technical Developers, Financiers and Real Estate Professionals around Sydney and elsewhere since his employment was terminated claiming it as his work.</p> 
                                <p>He is trying to raise funds from unsuspecting people presenting himself as a Real Estate Disruptor expert. As the newly self-appointed CEO of ‘Apex Enterprises’ he is attempting to convert the IP he has acquired during his short but disastrous stint at Hello Real Estate into some delusional ‘Real Estate Disruptor Model’ which he is modelling as a clone of Compass in the USA.</p>

                       <p>
                       	Hello Real Estate’s ASX plans and RTO were well underway in early 2015 some 6 months before Griffiths commenced his CEO probationary period, he was in no way involved in this initiative, in fact the RTO Partners saw his appointment as very negative and senior members of the team asked for him to be replaced. Griffiths was in no way involved in any of the Licensee Marketing and Recruitment programs as there was a dedicated team and strategy in place when he joined Hello. Griffiths never even met any of the Licensees until they were already signed up and operating with Hello.
                       </p>
                       <p>Griffiths had a 5 month probationary stint at Hello Real Estate Ltd during which time he obtained the information he is currently touting as his own. This information was developed by Hello Investors and Senior Management supported by professionally engaged consultants both in Australia and overseas, it does not belong to Griffiths, he has no legal or legitimate claim to any of this business information.</p>

                       <p>
                        Griffiths has never worked in the real estate space prior to his short time at Hello and he was terminated on the 31st December 2015 due to poor performance and what turned out to be false declarations to the board and shareholders by Griffiths and the CFO in respect to financial forecasts, creditor amounts (which were patently incorrect) and other matters. </p>

                    This was Griffiths only CEO role of his whole career, his only true claim to fame during his time at Broadreach was that he left the company after engaging Broadreach Services in litigation against its two largest clients. (Again this is all a matter of Public Record and easily confirmed by a call to the Broadreach owner).

                <P><span class="project-tagline">Strangely this position never existed, Perot Head Office in Hillsdale USA has never heard of Griffiths, if he had such a high profile job for 4 years with such a massive corporation  (which it appears he didn't) one would think that there would be at least one Perot Systems, Perot Corporation or other Perot division executive amongst Griffiths extensive LinkedIn Contacts, there are none! The DELL logo supporting his Perot job is an interesting addition as the DELL/PEROT deal was done after his claimed employment period with Perot</span></P>
